**What did I do in the Webpage?**<BR />
I learned how to make code more efficient and more organized. In the CSS file, I re-ordered all the classes and so they're more easily readable and more organized.
I also made the code look less disjunct. The index page didn't require too many changes. I added some semantic tags, the title of the webpage, and the alt tags for 
image descriptions in case the image doesn't display, or the user is disabled.

**What's the result of my work for this webpage?** <BR />
I looked at this page and did some extensive code refactoring to streamline the code and make it more presentable to any other people that may work on it in the future.

**What did I learn from this assignment?** <BR />
I learned to keep trying new things. A lot of my code elimination resulted from tinkering with the code. The other big lesson to learn is always get someone to proofread your 
assignment because it's very easy to think you have nothing left to do with an assignment, then you find out you had to do more after a peer review.
